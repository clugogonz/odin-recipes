    <h2>About this dish</h2>
    <p>Thick, tender fettuccine noodles are bathed in a rich, golden sauce of melted butter and savory parmesan, often finished with a hint of cracked black pepper for a subtle bite. It’s the ultimate comfort food—a lush, creamy symphony of salt and fat that clings perfectly to every strand of pasta for a melt-in-your-mouth experience.
