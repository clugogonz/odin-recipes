    <h2>About this dish</h2>
    <p>Bold, spicy, and unapologetically aromatic, Pad Kra Pao is the quintessential 
        Thai comfort meal centered around the sharp heat of fresh chilies and the 
        distinct perfume of holy basil. Served over jasmine rice with a signature 
        lacey-edged fried egg, it delivers a perfect balance of salty, spicy, and umami 
        flavors in every bite.</p>
     
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 shallots</li>
        <li>7 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>3 thai bird or holland chilies</li>
        <li>1 lb ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 of a cup of low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>holy basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a wok over medium high heat, add the oil, shallots and garlic, and fry for 3 minutes. Add the chilies and cook for another minute. Crank up the heat to high, and add the ground pork, breaking it up into small bits and allowing it to crisp up.
            </li>
        <li>Add the sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Stir-fry for another minute and deglaze the pan with the broth or water. Because your pan is over high heat, the liquid should cook off very quickly. Add the basil, and stir-fry until wilted. Serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
